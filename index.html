    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"We must fight for eternal life. It’s not passed out like peanuts."</i></p>

    <p class="w3-xlarge w3-margin-top w3-text-white">Rev. Rose M. Aluli</p>
       
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This message was given to the Church on December 12, 1984.</i></p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">Everlasting life is different from eternal life.  Something that is everlasting is moving and it doesn’t stop.  The only thing that is going to please Christ and the 
      Father is for man to be redeemed into his first estate.  As long as man accepts death, it is never fulfilled.  The only way we can come back in, is by our own faith and our own 
      determination that we’re going to receive it.  The flesh is the enemy that fights against this.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">It’s the end of Satan because we become spirit beings (that is, in the glorified state); that fight his forces in such power that he has no chance.  He can’t even 
      attack you with sickness when you come into that place.  Everything is different, although we might look the same.  We become completely enveloped in Christ.  We become one with Christ 
      and one with the Father.  It’s a birth of the Spirit.  We come into it by absolute obedience to God.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 Timothy 1:15-17</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus 
      came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them 
      which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</strong> Paul 
      was called to be a pattern after Jesus Christ for those who would believe on Him to life everlasting.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 Timothy 6:10-19 </strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted 
      after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</strong> Anything which we love can keep us from God.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But thou, 
      O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art 
      also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</strong> We must fight for eternal life.  It’s not passed out like peanuts.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> I 
      give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; That thou keep this commandment without 
      spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; Who only 
      hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.</strong> Until this time, 
      Christ was the only one who had immortality.  No natural flesh man can attain unto it.  There must be a birth in the Spirit that changes the flesh.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> 
        Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; That they do good, 
        that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on 
        eternal life.</strong></p>  
  
      
    <p class="w3-justify">Jesus was glorified before he ever came to earth.  He laid all of that aside and came down, and was formed after the order and flesh of sinful man, as an example, so 
      that we would know the way back to the Father.  When the blood of Christ covers you in your forgiveness of sins by the Spirit, you are an entirely new creation.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">John 10:17-18</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take 
      it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</strong></p>
      
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.1</p> 
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 7:16</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of 
      thistles?</strong> The fruit he is talking about is not joy, peace, love, et cetera.  That’s given to you.  He’s talking of the fruit of the kingdom, the ability to go in and out, 
      restricted by nothing, like Jesus after the resurrection.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 7:21-24</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of 
      heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</strong> It’s not being saved.  It’s entering into that invisible kingdom.<strong class="w3-text-red"> Many will say 
      to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, 
      I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</strong> It’s any who sin, those who won’t completely give it up.  They can’t enter the kingdom.
      <strong class="w3-text-red"> Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</strong> We have to 
      be just like Christ, where we won’t do anything, say anything, go anywhere lest God says to.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 8:1-4</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who 
      walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</strong> You can’t walk free of condemnation unless you are born after Christ.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For the law of the Spirit 
      of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of 
      sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</strong></p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 John 1:6-7</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do 
      not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.</strong> We can’t 
      have fellowship until we are changed by this new birth in the Spirit.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.2</p>   
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 8:5-23</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that 
      are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is 
      not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God 
      dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 
      But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 
      Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the 
      body, ye shall live.</strong> If you are carnally minded, live after the flesh, you can’t have everlasting life on the earth.  It doesn’t mean you die and go to hell.  It doesn’t mean you 
      can’t be saved.  It just means you go to the grave if you’re not walking after the Spirit.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the 
      sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness 
      with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified 
      together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature 
      waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, Because the 
      creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in 
      pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the 
      redemption of our body.</strong> We are not yet adopted.  That is the redemption of our body, the new birth.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 8:29</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of 
      his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</strong></p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">John 3:36</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the 
      Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</strong> The wrath of God is death.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">1 John 2:17</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of 
      God abideth for ever.</strong></p>  

    <p class="w3-justify w3-text-red w3-xlarge w3-center">Rose, ON LIFE</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Adam was formed out of the dust of the earth like the beasts of the earth.  God breathed life in him.  He came forth by the breath of life.  When Adam sinned, his 
      life was in the blood.  Resurrected Jesus came as flesh and bone.  Jesus shed his blood.  He gave his blood that man could inherit everlasting and eternal life.  Death was gone.  He died 
      so we won't have to die.  The blood of Christ destroyed the curse.  As long as we are flesh and blood, we shall die. The flesh is the proving ground to bring the spirit into subjection.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. John 3:36</p>
